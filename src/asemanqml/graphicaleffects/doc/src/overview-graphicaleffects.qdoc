    \title Graphical Effects
    \brief Effects provided by the Qt Graphical Effects API

    Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI
    components. To import the Qt Graphical Effects types, include the Qt
    Graphical Effects module by adding the following statement to the QML file:

    \qml \QtMinorVersion
    import QtGraphicalEffects 1.\1
    \endqml

    To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML
    scene and configure the effects properties. The source item type can be any
    QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining multiple effects together
    is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

    of Qt Graphical Effects:
